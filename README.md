Machine learning project to predict student exam scores.
# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

This project uses a machine learning model to predict student exam scores based on various behavioral, psychological, and environmental factors.

## 📌 Objective
To build a regression model that accurately predicts student performance and helps identify which factors impact exam scores the most.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle - Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/students-performance-in-exams)
- **File:** `StudentPerformanceFactors.csv`
- **Size:** ~96 KB
- **Features:**
  - `Hours Studied`
  - `Previous Scores`
  - `Sleep Hours`
  - `Attendance`
  - `Parental Education`
  - `Study Materials Access`
  - `Extra Classes`
  - ...and more

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Project Flow
1. Data Loading & Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Selection
4. Model Training using Linear Regression
5. Model Evaluation (R² Score)
6. Visualization: Actual vs Predicted Scores
7. Model Export (`.pkl` file)
